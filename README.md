### Pre-generated PNGs

A set of pre-generated PNGs are available for download at https://github.com/OGCMetOceanDWG/WorldWeatherSymbols/releases/download/0.6.0/WorldWeatherSymbols-0.6.0-png.zip.

### Building PNGs

To build PNG equivalents of the symbols, run ```./scripts/wws_manage.sh png```.  Output PNG files are located in ```png/```.  [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) is required to run the conversions.  

### Displaying the symbols on GitHub

WorldWeatherSymbols can be displayed directly on Github either by opening the symbol's svg file or by using [RawGit](https://rawgit.com/) to include symbols in Markdown-formatted files, example: ![Front_Cold_at_surface](https://cdn.rawgit.com/OGCMetOceanDWG/WorldWeatherSymbols/master/symbols/Ft_Fronts/WeatherSymbol_WMO_Front_Cold_at_surface.svg).
