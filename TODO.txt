Remove unnecessary deep grouping? I suggest each symbol is in a single group, rather than each in its own SVG?

Remove unnecessary transformations?

Remove unnecessary precision?

This could all remain as Version 5, as every files contains its version number in the metadata.

I suggest that V06 would be a different resolution, such as 100x100 or 20x20, or with optional styles encoded, or significant extra symbols added.
