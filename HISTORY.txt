V05

- Complete WMO set with standard metadata block in each symbol and correct metadata detail, including uris of files in Github. Removed explicit mention of "uri:".

Removed spurious DESC and TITLE elements. If more than one valid WMO description, put extra in DESC element, hierarchically, separated by colons.

Created extra table entry references needed for variations allowed by plotting model but not necessarily in Manual on Codes tables. E.g. Automatic station.

Suppressed style information in filenames, such as "monochromatic", as this is a presentation style, not semantic.

Added Aviation symbols.
